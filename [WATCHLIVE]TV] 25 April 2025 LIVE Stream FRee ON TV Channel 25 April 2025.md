The Madrid derby returns this midweek, but the stakes are far from equal as Atletico Madrid, now out of the title picture, host a Rayo Vallecano side still clinging to slim European hopes at the Metropolitano Stadium.

It‚Äôs been a turbulent stretch for Diego Simeone's men, whose campaign has unravelled across multiple fronts. Their Champions League journey came to a heartbreaking end in the Round of 16, falling to bitter rivals Real Madrid on penalties. That was followed by a Copa del Rey semi-final exit at the hands of Barcelona. To compound matters, their domestic form has dipped alarmingly, just two wins from their last six La Liga outings, culminating in a crushing stoppage-time defeat to Las Palmas over the weekend. The title chase is officially over.

On the other side, Rayo Vallecano, led by Inigo Perez, former assistant to Andoni Iraola, have remained faithful to their high-octane, energetic style. But as spring has rolled around, their performances have begun to fade, perhaps due to mid-table safety or the natural wear of a demanding system. They head into this clash off the back of a 1-1 draw against an in-form Valencia side, a result that keeps them hovering just outside the European places.

Atletico Madrid team news
While Diego Simeone now faces a largely ceremonial league run-in, he does so with a clean bill of health across his squad‚Äîa luxury, though perhaps a frustrating one, given how rotation decisions have arguably hindered their momentum earlier in the season.

One bright spot remains the form of Julian Alvarez, who continues to make a mark up front in what's been a promising debut campaign in Spain. His strike partner for this match remains uncertain.

Rayo Vallecano team news
As for Rayo, there are no new injury concerns to report. They could see Sergio Camello return from a toe issue, though they'll still be without key centre-back Abdul Mumin, sidelined with a knee injury.
